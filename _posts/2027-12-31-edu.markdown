I am Ph.D candidate advised by <a href="https://cv.snu.ac.kr/index.php/faculty//">Prof. Kyoung Mu Lee.</a>
I am interested in deep learning and computer vision, exploring human 3D reconstruction and image restoration, combining high-level and low-level tasks in my recent research.
I am currently dedicated to crafting images that match common visuals and reconstructing 3D human forms from severely degraded images.
